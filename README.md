## 📋 Project Description

This project aims to simulate a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of classifying network traffic into normal or malicious categories. Using the widely recognized **KDD Cup 1999** dataset, this system combines classical machine learning (Random Forest) and deep learning (Neural Networks) approaches to compare their performance in intrusion detection.
